									 Q1: The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of the internet).<br>Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. <br>Do they suggest solutions? If so, how do those solutions relate to the other article?	
									</p>

									<h3 align="center">
									 In the first article, John-Patrick Hartnett pointed out Adobe's standardized interface design is an industry hegemony. Its purpose is to prevent designers from using alternative solutions or relying too much on this software. The author doesn't seem to give a clear answer. At the end of the article, they put forward a series of questions for readers to think further, such as the diversity and independence of practical technology. This echoes some arguments of Becca Abbe in the second article that the network is a carrier hosting multiple worlds at the same time. Then the website can be a testing ground, a mini-utopia or a haven, free from the commercial network. Indeed, the author throws out similar multiple-choice questions: stay within the limits of the existing structure or leave the grid and build our structure. 	
									 <br> I think, as a user of Adobe, I can't completely deny that they can improve efficiency and form a flow closed-loop design process. To some extent, I think designers are passive, and we can't participate in design software development. In the future, I believe that the general trend of design software is likely to be more artificial intelligence, and the operating threshold will be lower and lower. We should be wary of not making things (posters, interfaces, etc.) machinery but thinking about what information in our design ultimately wants to convey to people.

										Q2: Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?
									   </p>
   
									   <h3 align="center">
										We need to build up design thinking and observation skills, keep curiosity and enhance aesthetics. My illustration professor said teaching concept is the most challenging task, and learning software or painting skills can be done through repeated practice.<br> 
										The cultivation of observation can be more sensitive to the perception of things around us, which may be helpful to the realization of ideas. <br>
										If we remain curious, we may have a new thirst for knowledge.

										<p class="round1", align="center">
											Q1: What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. 	
										   </p>
	   
										   <h3, align="center">
											My understanding is that Lialina's believes that universal users should have more voices, selection, engagement and awareness on software and websites. Not just letting programs think, or letting them work for us, or stick to obeying the original development intention of this software. <br>
											Users should have their purpose and consciousness, not just follow the feeding preferences from big companies, such as Google, Facebook, Youtube, etc. I want to say that this is undoubtedly a sobering thought for those who are pursuing the perfect customer experience. <br> This reminds me of a documentary, 
											The Social Dilemma, which mentioned how internet giants predicted users' behaviour through their profiles and data, then accurately advertise or make them constantly addicted to the screen. 
											That is to say, artificial intelligence and social media platforms quietly change human cognition of the world and the behaviours imposed on it step by step. <br>
											Maybe Lialina's point of view can resist these traps. Schwulst puts forward that websites should have unlimited possibilities, and artists can think widely about what websites can be. What to fill in this space is the result of our independent thinking. If we think the website to an empty room, 
											we have the right to decide its size, purpose, decoration style, what kind of furniture to put and so on. For example, the multimedia artist Wim Delvoye's website  <br>
											is a simulated city. Click on any building, farm or football field to view related artworks. This is very different from the websites of artists we know. I wonder if the website building platform like Wix or Squarespace has more editable and completely personalized definitions, not just based on their templates.

											   Q2: What kind of computer user are you? <br> Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).

											  <h3, align="center">
												I think I'm a General Purpose User. "We, general purpose users — not hackers and not people — who are challenging, consciously or subconsciously, what we can do and what computers can do, are the ultimate participants of man-computer symbiosis. <br>
												I can choose applications or websites according to my own preferences, instead of being passively dominated by software. I feel that my experience online is like a boat sailing for adventure. Sometimes I know that the next port is my destination, <br>
												but sometimes I don't know that I am taken to an island full of fantasy. There will be storms, and there will be sunny, but I still expect that my next destination will give me different surprises.

											Q: A key part to generative design and code is pattern and routine. Akin to a chess player, marking each move down, and keeping a trace of your decisions can prove useful for your own process and future making. <br>
											As a designer, to know that there might be a variety of possibilities to a given situation, can aid our ways of observing by using tools in novel ways. In one series of work, Van Rossum looks to fundamentals of waveforms as a departure point and reference point for connecting an interface to affecting the parameters of a letterform. <br>
											If the letters explode, so too would the speakers. Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic. Post a visual of this pattern and describe how it is programmatic in nature.  	
										   </p>
	                                                                        <img src ="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirsten-h/readingdiscussion/main/images/sand-dunes-patterns-in-death-valley-pierre-leclerc.jpg" alt="Sand dunes" width="900" height="600">

										   <h3 align="center">
											Sand dune or sandhill shows a natural pattern based on some of the variables. The sand particles continue to travel in the wind and eventually run to an obstacle. The obstacle could be the shape of the existing sand dune and then the particle just ends up on it and keeps accumulating. Sand is always in motion and the dunes are constantly shifting, <br>
											the variables can be the wind in this case. Wind direction and wind velocity shape sand in a different ways. Dunes are also influenced by factors like gravity, moisture, and event plants or animals' movement, which can have a dramatic effect on what a dune looks like. Dunes form around plants in the desert where this vegetation becomes an important structure <br>
											because it gives sand some stability constantly in motion. All in all, in the article "Dune and sheet pattern", it claims that: The relation between sand grain size and the shape of a dune is not, however, one of simple cause and effect (Links to an external site.), for the relation is not constant in all dunes of a given shape or in all localities. <br>
											It reminds me of Van Rossum, sound wave project. Use the program to illustrate what the sound looks like. Then translated the type into the sound. Next is going from sound to shape. Changing the frequency can make the shape different. Therefore frequencies can make the letterform. The frequency of sound waves may inspire font design. I wonder according to the results of these variables, can we reversely inspire our design process. In my opinion, the pattern of sand dunes has many uncertainties and randomness, but at the same time, it changes according to certain specific factors just like a programmatic.

											<p class="round1", align="center">
												Q: A major theme that runs throughout Steyerl’s essay is that of surveillance. <br>
												In your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s thought experiment.  
											   </p>   
											  
											 
											   <h3 align="center">
												Surveillance is a technology aimed at recording human behaviour. This can be a process of continuous attention and collection of a large amount of information, which is to collect, influence and manage people's behaviour.<br>
												Various authorities use surveillance systems to strengthen management, especially when dealing with security issues. It is not difficult for us to think of the new wave of monitoring citizens in the United States after the 9.11 terrorist attacks. <br>
												This is mainly the electronic information collection and monitoring of telephone and e-mail, the Internet, and the tracking of mobile phones and GPS units. With the advent of video recording equipment, surveillance cameras and digital cameras, it is possible to monitor the subject remotely. <br>
                                                                                                If we look up, we live in a world full of cameras. The city of Toronto uses about 2,000 video surveillance cameras in city-owned facilities (Jenny Yuen). These cameras interweave into an invisible net, like being shrouded in countless eyes. So I think of George Orwell's "1984". <br>
												His imaginary story is that our future is under the supervision of Big Brother, and the totalitarian state controls people's thoughts and behaviours through surveillance. If the camera's original purpose is to crack down on crime or traffic monitoring, <br>
												how can we ensure that people's privacy is inviolable? Undoubtedly, non-standard private individuals or enterprises are also using such monitoring technology. As we know, detaining or monitoring us citizens intensifies the increasing debate about violating civil liberties. <br>
                                                                                                If you "vertically" rise from the surveillance camera, it will reach the satellite's height, and I found an example. In this article, the continuous improvement of satellite image resolution is helping the space detective agency work. <br>
												"As an example, PlanetLabs promises a 50-gigapixel snapshot of the whole planet, every day, once it has 100 cubesats in orbit. (Paul Marks)" That is to say, the Earth-imaging satellites may impact future privacy. The article also points out that satellites can be used for cross-border monitoring, <br> 
												large-scale monitoring of different social lifestyles, and even tracking of individuals.
